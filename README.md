The goal of this repo is to implement permafrost dynamics in an energy balance model of the Arctic to capture non-linear feedback terms
which occur as a consequence of increasing global temperatures. 

Work presented in this repo is built off [An energy balance model for paleoclimate transitions](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-493-2019) and is a joint effort with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Guelph.  For a mathematical description of the model refer to *Model_Description.pdf*
